# Express.js Note Taker Application

## Description

This project required me to build the back-end functionality for a fully designed front-end note-taking application. The application allows users to create, view, and delete notes, improving productivity and organization.

In this project:

- I used server-side logic using Node.js and the Express.js framework to handle routing, file management, and API functionality. 

- I deployed the application using Render, gaining hands-on experience with modern deployment workflows.

- I used RESTful API routes to handle GET, POST, and DELETE requests for note management.

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of server-side development, deployment processes, and creating scalable, user-friendly applications.
